# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple, interactive console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using C++. Built as a two-player game, it runs entirely in the terminal and demonstrates core programming concepts such as control structures, 2D arrays, functions, and input validation.

Features:
1. 3x3 dynamic game board
2. Two-player input (Player X and Player O)
3. Win detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
4. Draw detection when the board is full
5. Input validation for correct moves
6. Clean and minimalistic console interface
